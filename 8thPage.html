            <h2>Future Transformation</h2>
               </center>
        <p>Advances in fields like artificial intelligence and behavioral analytics are helping us keep pace with ever-more resourceful criminals.<br><br>

There are a number of interesting ways advanced technology is being used to combat criminal activity, especially as more of that activity takes place digitally. Increased use of artificial intelligence and machine learning are two of the big ones – but the thing that really excites me is the use of behavioral analytics for identity verification.<br><br>

        <h3>How behavioral analytics work and how it will help</h3><br>
Take your smartphone, for example. Most people use a finger to unlock the phone with a PIN code. If I happen to get your pin code, I can technically break into your phone, but that may soon change. There are companies that are now looking at things like how you normally hold your phone, with which hand, and how much pressure you use when you tap on the screen. So although I may enter the right pin code, the system will be able to say, “Well, I’m not sure that’s really you because that’s not how you normally hold the phone. I have no record of you holding the phone that way” and deny access or ask for an additional verification method.<br><br>

When you couple all these components together around this notion of identity, you can use some really interesting and advanced technology components to try to solve some problems…from the above “Is this person holding the phone the rightful owner or not?” to “Does this credit card transaction look normal?” to “These transactions are occurring at a time of day I would not have expected.” Credit card companies are already making good use of behavioral analytics by flagging purchases that seem unusual based on a user’s location and typical buying patterns.<br><br>

I think going further down this behavioral identity road is both fascinating and compelling. Here at Thomson Reuters, we already have a number of really valuable data sets and propositions to help reduce the risk of fraudulent, criminal  and terrorist activity through identity verification. Our CLEAR solution, as one example, was critical to identifying the perpetrators in the 2015 San Bernardino shootings, which enabled law enforcement to catch them and prevent further casualties. Our wide range of assets gives us the ability to aggregate from multiple places, better streamline the onboarding process and do the verification/risk management piece that fundamentally is what identity is trying to solve. And as more advanced behavioral analytics and algorithms come into the mix, these solutions will become even stronger.<br><br>
