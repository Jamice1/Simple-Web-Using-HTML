        <h2>Fraud</h2>
        <p><em>According to idology.com</em>, Over the past few decades there has been a shift in how criminals target organizations and their customers. Due in large part to advances in technology, especially with the continued growth of the online marketplace, businesses have to constantly fight fraud in order to protect their own interests as well as their customers’ privacy.<br><br>
   The arrival of ecommerce solutions and the willingness of consumers to shop for products and conduct business online have changed the game for retailers and financial service providers. In addition to criminals shifting from passing bad checks to replicating credit cards, they have also benefited from the amount of information now available to anyone with an Internet connection – especially the valuable stolen identity information currently available on the Dark Web.

        <h2>Terrorism</h2>
        <p><em>According to Fortune.com</em>, Technological advances have provided terrorists with significant new opportunities. Technology has tended to have an impact on sub-state violence. While militant groups seek to capitalize on new advances, states leverage these same platforms, including for surveillance and getting information from local populations.

        <h2>Burglary</h2>
        <p>People would think they are completely safe in their homes and are no longer a target of burglary but that’s not entirely the truth. Technology has done a great job of giving persons a peace of mind with the advance burglary systems that are made for homes. But these new advance systems are not immune to being hacked. With the developed technology, hackers are able to gain access to these burglary systems giving burglars access to the building, they can enter and exit into the building without even being noticed; if that’s what they want.<br><br>
        <em>According to Rose Cabrera (CSO Online)</em>, Aside from burglars, there are also hackers that can compromise your home’s safety. Although these hackers may not be able to do serious physical harm, they compromise your finances, personal data and even your identity.</p>
