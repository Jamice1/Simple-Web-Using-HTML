        </center>
        <p>Hello guys! My name is Jamice Martin. I am an 18-year-old who currently attends the University of Technology, Jamaica W.I. as a student. My course of study is Computing Science and with God’s almost guidance and mercy I’d love to become an I.T Consultant. Getting a better and 
deeper understanding about technology is my #1 goal. I am an indoor person who enjoys one’s company. In my free time I love to surf the net, watch movies, read novels and listen music. My motto of life is; “life is short so live it while you can”.
